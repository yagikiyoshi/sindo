#
#  Resource File version 1:
#
#  Describe the resource available for each task in one line.
#
#   HOSTNAME ppn=N mem=M scr=K
#
#     HOSTNAME  ... hostname(s) of the node separated with colons(:)
#        ppn    ... process per node
#        mem    ... memory in GB
#        scr    ..  scratch disk in GB
#
#     (Each parameter must be separated either by commas(,) or spaces.)
#
#  IMPORTANT NOTE!
#   Never specify the total memory of the node in "mem". If you did, the task  
#   would run using the whole memory of the node, which might cause the node 
#   to hang up. Always be sure to leave an enough amount of memory for the OS.  
#
#  Example:
#  The following example invokes 5 tasks on diva and kushana. 
#
# Task 0: All parameters must be present here.
diva01 ppn=8 mem=8 scr=400

# Task 1: A missing parameter is assumed to be the same as the first line.
diva02                              

# Task 2: Parameters are case insensitive and can be separated by camma and/or space.   
diva03,pPn=8,Mem=8, SCR=400

# Task 3: 12 cores for kushana.
kushana01 ppn=12

# Task 4: The portion after '#' does not take effect.
kushana02 ppn=12 # mem=10 scr=400

# Task 5: A task using multiple nodes. The hostnames must be separated by colon(:) without spaces.
kushana03:kushana04 ppn=12
